## DEPRECATION NOTICES: The future_lapply() function has moved to the
## future.apply package.  Going forward, please make sure to use that
## one instead, by using:
##
##   library("future.apply")

## Regardless of the future plan, the number of workers,
## and where they are, the random numbers will be identical

plan(multiprocess)
y2 <- future_lapply(1:5, FUN = rnorm, future.seed = 0xBEEF)
str(y2)
